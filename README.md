### Overview:

EMStudio is an open source tuning application for engines. It currently directly supports rusEFI, however best effort is made to ensure it stays in-spec with the base INI format, and thus maintain compatability with Speeduino and Megasquirts itself.

### Binaries:

[![Windows](https://github.com/malcom2073/emstudio/actions/workflows/win-build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/malcom2073/emstudio/actions/workflows/win-build.yml)

Windows binaries are available in the github release section, OSX/Ubuntu/Fedora are TODO.

#### Windows:
